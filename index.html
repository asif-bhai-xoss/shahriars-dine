        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am Md. Asif Shahriar, owner of Shahriar's Dine. This place was
          bought by my father in 1985. It was just a small place back then. But
          from time to time it gets popular so we had decided to make it larger.
          You can find all kind of tradiotonal foods here. The behavior of the
          employees also good. Visit us.

      <p class="recipie recipie-position">
        We have some spicy dishes. Among them, there are three signature items.
        We always value our customers and we never compromise about the food
        quality.

          <h2>Soup</h2>
          <p class="three-items">
            Soup is a primarily liquid food, generally served warm or hot (but
            may be cool or cold), that is made by combining ingredients of meat
            or vegetables with stock, milk, or water. Hot soups are additionally
            characterized by boiling solid ingredients in liquids in a pot until
            the flavors are extracted, forming a broth.

          <h2>Spicy Steak</h2>
          <p class="three-items">
            Beefsteak is a flat cut of beef, usually cut perpendicular to the
            muscle fibers. Beefsteaks are usually grilled, pan-fried, or
            broiled. The more tender cuts from the loin and rib are cooked
            quickly, using dry heat, and served whole. Less tender cuts from the
            chuck or round are cooked with moist heat or are mechanically
            tenderized (e.g. cube steak).

          <h2>Beany Honey</h2>
          <p class="three-items">
            Honey consists essentially of different sugars predominantly glucose
            and fructose as well as other substances derived from the collection
            of nectar by honey bees for conversion into honey. With the beans,
            the whole item taste super delicious.
